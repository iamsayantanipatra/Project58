For many months, it has been almost it's going to be 1 year, learning and doing coding.

      I love coding because- it really excites me, it is fun to do. It really excites me whenever I come across a problem, I get curious about solving it. I am a person who loves to solve puzzles, questions involving logic and thinking ability.</p>

    <p class="imtext">And the most reason that I love coding is because of my teacher Gargi Mam, and my parents. Without them, I have never been able to do coding.
